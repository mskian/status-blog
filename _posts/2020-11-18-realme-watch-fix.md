Bought Realme Watch on August 18, 2020, to Track My Fitness Activities Mainly for Outdoor Cycling and Walking.

Here are a Few reasons Why I choose this Watch

- Watch Look and Screen Size
- Workout Options
- Drinking Reminder and Idle Alert

Started using the Watch Continuously 2 Months Working Smooth without Any issues
Mid October got Realme App Link Update and OTA Update - Updated both
but issues started from Daily Usage

- Map Gone
- Workout details gone
- Finally GPS Connection issue

Without GPS Connection some workout Modes are Not Working Properly

I try Many things from My side to Connect the GPS

- Restart
- Reconnect the Watch
- Even factory Reset

Finally came to the Solution it was a Bug in their recent Updates

November 5 Got a new update Finally GPS issue was Fixed but after a Some days, I noticed steps are not Counted but in some Scaniero it counts but not fully.

I check Every permission of the APP Everything is Perfect but How I fix it?

## Realme Watch Fix Steps are not Counted

- Open `Manage Apps > Realme Link App > Permissions`
- Enable Body Sensors Permission and Close it
- Next `ON` the Bluetooth - Open app > Connect Watch and Sync the data
- Now close the App and `OFF` Bluetooth
- Again `ON` the Bluetooth verify your watch it's Connected to the Bluetooth or Not
- Walk few Steps wait for some min and check Steps are Counted or Not
- After all Test `OFF` Bluetooth Open Realme Link App Permission and Disable the Body Sensors Permission
- Restart the Watch `(Settings > System > Restart)`
- Don't `ON` the Bluetooth this time Just wear a Watch and Walk some Distance
- After a 2 to 3 Minutes check the Steps are counted or Not

Still, I Have no idea How it Fixes the Steps **Counting issue**
